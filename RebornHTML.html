              RSA or Rivest-Shamir-Adleman is a public-key cryptosystem that has been used around the world as a security mechanism to enhance the security of data via transmission. It was created by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman and the algorithm was brought to light in 1977.
              Because this is an asymmetric cryptosystem the public key is different from the private decryption key. The public key in RSA is generated from two really large prime numbers which are kept hidden from involving parties. The system is defunct if the prime numbers are acquired by an individual as the encryption and decryption can easily be reversed.
              The genius behind the system is that it is basically impossible to reverse the math involved with the prime numbers as such is called the ”factoring problem”. Currently there are no methods to break through RSA encryption.

            Key Generation:
            <li> We have two grab to large primes, (random) for learning convinience we will choose p and q from 11-100.</li>
            <li> We now compute N (modulus) using n=pq</li>
            <li> Compute Φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1), labeled as L in our case.</li>
            <li> Choose an integer e (public exponent), 1 < e < ϕ, such that gcd(e,ϕ)=1.
                 For learning convinience we will choose the first available. </li>
            <li> Compute the d (secret exponent), 1 < d < ϕ, such that ed≡1modϕ. </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            In effect:
            <li> When encrypting and decrypting we have to assign the characters to
                 a number to compute the math. In this case we have converted them to ASCII.</li>
            <li> Encrypted Data c = 89^e mod n. </li>
            <li> Decrypted Data = c^d mod n. </li>

            The Caesar Cipher is a shift cipher, meaning that the methodology that the cipher goes by is replacing
            each letter in the message by a certain shift which is the assigned key of the scenario. In the Caesar
            Cipher each plaintext letter is shifted by a fixed number to another in the alphabet. For example, the
            plaintext “a” shifted by 3 would be “d”. Due to the fact that the Caesar Cipher is a mono-alphabetic
            cipher it is rendered useless in real world applications. There are ways to improve the cipher, but
            it isn’t worth it compared to the alternatives in the world. The Caesar Cipher is a good basis to learn
            encryption or have a fun way to communicate with your friends.
